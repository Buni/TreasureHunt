# TreasureHunt

Android App, where you must go to each location to get the next clue. I am building this app to refamiliarize myself with the Android development process, as well as get familiar with Google Maps API.

The app is meant to be a crowdsourced treasure hunt, where the users will provide clues to different locations. To unlock the next clue, the person following the hunt, must visit the location revealed by the clue, and thus proceed.
